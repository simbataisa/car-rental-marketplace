# Customer Booking Management Feature

## Overview

This feature enables Admin users to support external customers by providing role-based access to the booking management system. External customers can only view and manage their own bookings, while Admin users can view and manage all bookings to provide customer support.

## Key Features

### For Admin Users
- **Full Access**: View and manage all customer bookings
- **Customer Support**: Ability to help external customers with their bookings
- **Complete Management Tools**: Edit orders, contact customers, view financials, manage status
- **Role-based Permissions**: All administrative functions available

### For Customer Users
- **Personal Bookings Only**: Can only see their own bookings (filtered by Firebase UID)
- **Simplified Interface**: Clean, customer-focused UI without administrative clutter
- **Essential Information**: View booking details, status, and payment information
- **Limited Actions**: View-only access with basic booking management

## Implementation Details

### Database Schema Changes

#### Order Interface Updates
```typescript
interface Order {
  id: string
  orderNumber: string
  customerId: string // NEW: Firebase UID of the customer who made the booking
  customerName: string
  customerEmail: string
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Role-based Filtering

#### Customer Access Control
```typescript
// Customers can only see their own orders
if (userRole === 'customer') {
  filtered = filtered.filter(order => order.customerId === user?.uid)
}
```

#### Admin Support Capability
```typescript
// Admin and other staff roles can see all orders (for supporting external customers)
if (userRole === 'admin' || userRole === 'customer_service') {
  // No filtering - can see all orders to provide customer support
}
```

### UI Adaptations

#### Dynamic Page Title
- **Admin View**: "Order Management" - "Manage and track all rental orders"
- **Customer View**: "My Bookings" - "View and track your rental bookings"

#### Conditional Table Columns
- **Hidden for Customers**: Customer information, Priority, Assigned To
- **Visible for All**: Order #, Vehicle, Dates, Status, Actions
- **Conditional**: Amount (based on financial permissions)

#### Simplified Filters for Customers
- **Customer View**: Search and Status filters only
- **Admin View**: All filters (Search, Status, Priority, Source)

## User Experience

### Customer Journey
1. Customer logs in with their account
2. Navigates to "My Bookings" (via account page or direct link)
3. Sees only their own bookings in a clean, simplified interface
4. Can search and filter by status
5. Can view booking details

### Admin Support Journey
1. Admin logs in with admin account
2. Accesses "Order Management" with full administrative interface
3. Can see all customer bookings
4. Can search for specific customer orders
5. Can provide support by viewing, editing, or managing any booking
6. Can contact customers directly through the interface

## Security Considerations

### Data Access Control
- Customer users can only access orders where `customerId` matches their Firebase UID
- Admin users have full access for customer support purposes
- Role verification happens on both frontend and should be enforced on backend

### Permission System
```typescript
const rolePermissions: Record<UserRole, RolePermissions> = {
  customer: {
    canViewAll: false,        // Can only see own bookings
    canEdit: false,           // Read-only access
    canDelete: false,         // Cannot delete bookings
    canAssign: false,         // Cannot assign staff
    canViewFinancials: false, // Cannot see financial details
    canManageStatus: false,   // Cannot change status
    canContactCustomer: false,// Cannot contact other customers
    canViewReports: false     // Cannot access reports
  },
  admin: {
    // Full permissions for customer support
    canViewAll: true,
    canEdit: true,
    canDelete: true,
    // ... all permissions enabled
  }
}
```

## Integration Points

### Account Page Integration
- The account page "Bookings" tab now redirects to the unified orders page
- Provides consistent experience across the application
- Eliminates duplicate booking management interfaces

### Navigation
- Customer users can access their bookings via:
  - Account page → Bookings tab → "View My Bookings" button
  - Direct navigation to `/admin/orders` (automatically filtered)
  - Custom route `/customer-bookings` (redirects to orders page)

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live booking status updates
2. **Customer Notifications**: Email/SMS notifications for booking changes
3. **Mobile App**: Dedicated mobile interface for customers
4. **Advanced Filtering**: Date range filters, location-based filtering
5. **Booking Modifications**: Allow customers to modify their own bookings
6. **Support Chat**: Integrated chat system between customers and admin

### Backend Integration
- Replace mock data with real Firestore queries
- Implement proper security rules in Firestore
- Add API endpoints for booking management
- Integrate with payment processing systems

## Testing Scenarios

### Customer User Testing
1. Login as customer user
2. Verify only own bookings are visible
3. Confirm administrative columns are hidden
4. Test search and status filtering
5. Verify cannot access other customers' data

### Admin User Testing
1. Login as admin user
2. Verify all bookings are visible
3. Confirm full administrative interface
4. Test customer support workflows
5. Verify can manage any customer's booking

### Cross-role Testing
1. Switch between customer and admin roles
2. Verify UI adapts correctly
3. Confirm data access restrictions
4. Test permission boundaries

This implementation provides a solid foundation for customer booking management while maintaining security and providing excellent user experience for both customers and admin support staff.
